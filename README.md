# Random-Matrices-Portfolio-Optimization
Bias reduction for covariance matrices applied to portfolio optimization. With random matrix literature techniques.

The bias reduction techniques applied to the portfolio optimization are:
  - Clipping method
  - TW method
  - Linear shrinkage
  - Non linear shrinkage

The program also runs a minimum variance portfolio, with two financial models:
  - Markowitz
  - Hierarchical risk parity (With k-means and Markowitz as the methods implemented)

Lastly the results are measured visually with Efficient frontiers and numerically with a series of metrics:
  - RMSE
  - RMAE
  - Frobenius ratio
  - Treynor ratio
  - Sharpe ratio
  - Jensen's alpha
